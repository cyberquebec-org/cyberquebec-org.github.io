  CyberQuébec's field of intervention is cybersecurity, i.e. all activities aimed at protecting individuals and businesses from malicious use of computers and, particularly, when the resources mobilized are connected to a communications network.
  As a College Technology Transfer Center (CCTT), CyberQuébec's actions fall within the four main areas of intervention that are common to the Synchronex network centers:

      **Cybersecurity is important for you. Believe us!**
        * Do you know how many passwords do you use?
        * Have you ever used the same password for more than one website at a time?
        * Do you need to share a password with collaborators?
        * Do you know the impacts of your everyday use of the Internet on your personal and professional life?

      **Zero risk does not exist, but we can help SMEs, small organizations and common mortals realize their level of maturity in cybersecurity. A few basic measures can also greatly mitigate the risk of the most common attacks.**
